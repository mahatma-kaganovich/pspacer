#labels Linux,HTB
= Introduction =
I have observed a HTB accuracy problem on the Linux kernel 2.6.30 and the Myri-10G 10 GbE NIC.
HTB can control the transmission rate at Gigabit speed, however it can not work well at 10 Gigabit speed.

I guess that HTB has a problem related to the time granularity.
I want to know what is happen, and what should be do for fixing it.

Any comments and suggestions will be welcome.

= Experiment =

== Experimental setting ==
We use 2 PCs, comprised of two Intel Quad-core Xeon E5430 2.66~GHz,
Intel 5100 chipset, 4 GB memory (DDR2-667), and Myricom Myri-10G
Ethernet interface, which plugged into a PCI-Express x8 lane.  The MTU
size is set to 9000 bytes.
Each PC is running the Ubuntu 9.04 server edition and the Linux kernel
2.6.30.  The version of iproute2 is ss080725.
Some networking sysctl parameters were changed from the
default value, as follows:

|| net.core.netdev_max_backlog || 250000 ||
|| net.core.wmem_max                 || 16777216 ||
|| net.core.rmem_max                  || 16777216 ||
|| net.ipv4.tcp_rmem                    || 4096 87380 16777216 ||
|| net.ipv4.tcp_wmem                   || 4096 65536 16777216 ||

The clock source is set to 'tsc.'

== Experimental results ==
I measured the average bandwidth over a period of 5 seconds by using
the Iperf benchmark. The target rate, which is controlled by both
PSPacer and HTB, was set from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps every
100 Mbps. 

HTB is formed in a stepwise shape, as shown in Fig.1.

Fig.2 shows the difference between the target rate and the observed average bandwidth.
HTB shows larger difference and wider variance than
PSPacer. The observed bandwidth is up to 0.8 Gbps more than the
target rate.
