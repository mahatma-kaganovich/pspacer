Problem of OCZ Z-Drive p84 read performance

= Summary =

I installed OCZ Z-Drive p84 into my Linux box.  I am using mptsas driver instead of the official binary driver
(megasar).  I ran two benchmark programs; bonnie++ and dd.  The results show the throughput 
of sequential read achieves 260 MB/s, which is the half of write performance (520 MB/s).

I have not yet tried to work on Windows OS.

What is the bottleneck of read performance?

Any comments and suggestions will be welcome.

= Experiment =

== Experimental setting ==
My PC consists of two Intel Quad-core Xeon E5430 2.66~GHz, Intel 5100 chipset, 
4 GB memory (DDR2-667), and OCZ Z-Drive p84 (256 GB MLC), 
which plugged into a PCI-Express x8 lane.
The PC is running the Ubuntu 9.10 server edition and the Linux kernel is 2.6.31-14-server.
The version of mptsas driver is 3.04.10.

== Experimental result ==

== Test script ==
This script assumes the target drive is /dev/sdb1 and it is mounted on /media/test.
